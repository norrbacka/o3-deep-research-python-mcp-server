# o3-deep-research-python-mcp-server

The goal of this repository is to have a MCP server that can be used by coding agents such as Gemini and Claude Code to call Azure OpenAI O3 Deep Research for doing investigative research on coding tasks. 

In many cases the outputs of coding agents like Claude Code is perfected once it has better context. Deep Research produces just that: BETTER CONTEXT.

For now Private Repository
